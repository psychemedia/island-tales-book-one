# In Percy Stone's *Legends and Lays of the Wight*

In *Legends and Lays of the Wight* first published in 1912, local architect, author and archaeologist, Percy G. (Goddard) Stone quotes the summary of the legend of Godshill from *Barber's Picturesque Illustrations of the Isle of Wight*, before retelling the tale more colourfully in verse:

> They had gathered them in from the countryside round  
> To settle a serious matter.  
> The question was this:  
> They sore needed a church  
> But they seemed very like to be left in the lurch,  
> And the whole thing to finish in chatter.  
>
> Shall we build it up there on the top of the down,  
> Or here in the valley below?  
> As at all parish meetings, a number said Aye  
> The hill is the spot for it's open and high,  
> While the rest called them fools, and said No.  

> And while they thus argued for valley or hill  
> In the weary parochial way.  
> The Devil drew near, in the guise of a Friar  
> — The Devil is always a plausible liar,  
> And put in his word for the Nay.  
>
> 'Why burden yourself with the onerous task  
> Of building up there on the height?  
> The carriage of stone will entail a sad toil,  
> So listen to me, honest sons of the soil.  
> Below's the most practical site.'  
>  
> 'The holy monk's right,' shouted those who agreed  
> To the vale scheme. Beelzebub lied.  
> As he always can do, with such hearty good will  
> That most of the folk who'd declared for the hill  
> Turned about and came over his side.  
>  
> Satan reckoned, if tucked away snug out of sight,  
> 'Twould be more out of mind of the Saints.  
> Besides, with the muddy and waltorish ways,  
> They would sure be more likely to curse than to praise,  
> Thus their prayers would get choked with complaints.  
>
> St. Boniface, passing, soon saw what was on,  
> So put in his vote for the hill.  
> Don't listen to fossils like him —  
> Slaves to orthodox precedent, crotchet and whim,  
> Quoth Satan, 'Tis clear, friends, his knowledge is nil.'  
>  
> So to it they went with a hearty good will.  
> Said the Saint, 'It is just as I feared:  
> Though the fools wouldn't listen to what I'd to say,  
> Beelzebub shan't have it all his own way'  
> And he thoughtfully pulled at his beard.  

> So the masons hewed stones and then set them in
place,  
> Chipping hard till the daylight had sped.  
> Then gathering their tools, with a sigh of content  
> At the work they had done, gaily homewards they went  
> To supper, and after to bed.

> Next morning betimes they arose with the lark  
> And set forth to work with a will.  
> But lo! when they got there, 'twas level with ground.  
> — Not a sign of a stone to be anywhere found  
> They were all laid atop of the hill.  
>  
> 'Here, bother it all!' the head mason exclaimed  
> 'Who's been playing the fool with this job?'  
> 'If I catch him, mark well' — and he doubled his fist,  
> With a look that I wouldn't for money have missed,  
> "I'll trounce him right soundly begob!"  
>  
> His comrades, sore puzzled, looked up and looked down,  
> Then exclaimed with unanimous voice  
> — They knew nothing about it so strike 'em all dead  
> As after their suppers they went straight to bed,  
> And had naturally stayed there, for choice.  
>  
> So it's up to the top of the hill they must toil  
> And fetch all those stones down again.  
> While they swore at the fool who had played them the trick  
> — Of course the first person they thought of was Nick,  
> And given them toiling in vain.  
>  
> Once again in their places the pieces secured,  
> They mortared them surely and true.  
> But when morning dawn lightened, the stones as before  
> — Whereat the whole company lustily swore  
> Were ranged on the hill-top anew.  
>  
> Said the stout master mason, a-scratching his head,  
> 'This is getting too much of a jest;  
> Let alone double toil, it will never get done:  
> 'Tis the job of a lifetime for every one:  
> From our labour we never shall rest.'  
>  
> When the very next morning the same thing occurred.  
> 'Stop, mates: let it be. The whole thing's  
> A puzzle too tough for my nob;  
> The Building Committee must settle this job:  
> It's a bit too perplexing for me.'  
>  
> So they called them together and met once again  
> And argued it worse than before.  
> They argued it up and they argued it down,  
> Like the council elect of a small county town,  
> Till they argued their very throats sore.  
>  
> Then Boniface Saint he laughed low in his beard:  
> "'Tis Isle of Wight calves that you be.  
> Are your heads then so thick that you can't understand  
> When from Heaven you're graciously sent a command,  
> It 's a miracle, easy to see."  
>  
> 'You scorned the advice of a credited saint'  
> — Here his stature a full cubit rose,  
> 'Who was never convicted of being a liar,  
> And hung on the words of this sham shaven friar,  
> Who led all you fools by the nose.'  
>  
> "A friar forsooth!  'Neath his cowl and his frock  
> Horns and hooves I can clearly perceive.  
> — This has been one of your narrowest shaves ±  
> Come hither, Beelzebub, subtlest of knaves,  
> And your recompense duly receive."  
> 
> Saint Boniface here gripped him tight by the neck,  
> "With, None of your sly monkey tricks"  
> Then, catching him fair with the point of his toe,  
> He lifted the Devil a furlong or so  
> With a couple of right lusty kicks.

> Whereat the parishioners fell on their knees  
> And lauded the Saint to the sky.  
> So Boniface blessed them in orthodox way.  
> Then, looking around him, proceeded to say,  
> 'This humility's mostly my eye.  
>  
> 'Next time don't be led by a plausible rogue  
> Unknown to the Parish and you  
> Though I've heard it, my friends, reprehensibly said  
> By Christians, alas! who are easily led,  
> We must render the Devil his due.  
>  
> 'Avoid mendicant friars, and take this advice  
> I tender you ere I depart:  
> Don't argue it more. Work away with a will  
> At building your church on the top of the hill,  
> Every man of you bearing his part.'  
>  
> 'We assure you, good Saint, we will do as you say.  
> But, ere that you bid us *adieu*,  
> Grant this favour benign, that our newly-built church  
> — By Beelzebub's guile nearly left in the lurch,  
> May be titled in honour of you.'  
>  
> "Though I'm flattered, the honour I needs must decline  
> — Besides I'm bespoken elsewhere  
> When everything's finished, to carving and paint,  
>  Let your church be invoked in the name of each saint  
> By whom you're accustomed to swear."  

> All humbly they cried, 'It shall be as you wish.  
> Your Saintship; we'll work with a will  
> And the site where the building in future will stand,  
> According to God's and your saintly command,  
> Shall be known by the name of GODSHILL.'

> The church there to-day on the top of the mound  
> Lifts its pinnacled Tower to sky  
> While a mile to the South Devil's Acre is found  
> — Which maids in the dark are afraid to pass round,  
> Two proofs to you Legends don't lie.
