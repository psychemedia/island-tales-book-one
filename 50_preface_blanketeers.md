# Preface

Set against a backcloth of increasing food prices, lowering wages, a lack of representation in Parliament, and the impending *Suspension of Habeas Corpus Act*, the people of Manchester gathered, created a petition, and set off on a march to London, with blankets over their shoulders and a petition proudly pinned to it.

This storynote collates news articles, reports and reflections, as well as Parliamentary reports, relating to what quickly came to be known as: *the march of the Blanketeers*.
