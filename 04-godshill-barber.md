# Tourist Guide Descriptions

*Barber's Picturesque Illustrations of the Isle of Wight*, published in 1850, describes how *"[r]ustic tradition tells that a more lowly spot was first selected for the erection of the church; but that the materials employed for that purpose, day by day, being regularly removed by invisible agents to the summit of the hill during the night, the workmen at length wisely determined to save themselves further unnecessary trouble, and built the church where some supernatural authority so plainly intimated that it must be erected.*

A slightly more religious telling is provided in "The Isle of Wight" by George Clinch, published in 1908, quoting an *"ancient legend which is thus given in a local guide-book"*:

> The people of this village, having long lived in pagan darkness, were at length visited by a holy man who came and lived among them. He told the wondrous story of Divine self-sacrifice, and taught the Catholic religion of love and mercy. This so touched the hearts of the people that they cast down their blood-stained altars and acknowledged the true God.  
>  
> Then cried the elders of the village: "We will build a temple to His honour, where we and our children's children may worship, and by which generations yet  unborn may know how the Saxon reverenced God."  
>  
> They chose, therefore, a level place, and all day long they wrought and toiled, and when night came they rested from their labours. But on the morrow, when borne during the night by invisible hands to the top of a round knoll.  
>  
> When the people saw this marvellous sight they cried with one voice: "Let us build now on the top of the hill, for this must be the will of God," and from that time the church and village have been known as Godshill in memory of this great deed.

Clinch goes on to describe how *[t]his legend, which may have been invented in explanation of a rather remarkable name, belongs to a class of which numerous examples still linger in England"*:

> Usually one finds them in places where the parish church stands at a considerable distance from the village, and, generally, they are to the effect that the building erected in or near the village during the day-time was conveyed by evil influences to a remote situation at night. The Godshill legend is a variant of this group.
