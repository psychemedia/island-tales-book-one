# The Nottinghamshire Outbreaks Continue

In the first quarter of 1812, frame breaking was to continue in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, although I will not be including reports of most of those events here. My intention in this section is more to describe those actions that impacted on Mr. Benjamin Topham.

It is, however, perhaps worth noting that reports of the actions in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire continued to appear in the *Leeds Mercury*. Who knows to what extent these reports might have helped motivate or inspire the men who would lead the machine breaking activities in West Yorkshire, and particularly in Huddersfield, in that first quarter of 1812?

RIOTS IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE. *(From the Review of Friday last.)* In recording the depredations of the frame-breakers, we have been led to hope each succeeding week would terminate these ever to be lamented transactions. In this, however, we have been mistaken; for each succeeding week has hitherto been accompanied by succeeding crimes, and our present records present a scene not less lamentable than the one given in our last; and prove that neither the vigilance of police officers, the terror of the military, nor even the impending penalties of the law, are sufficient to suppress this spirit of revolt. It is with pleasure we state that one reputable house in this town (Wm. Nunn and Co.) have publicly announced that they have taken off all the frame rent, and are giving the full prices. This conduct, if followed by other manufacturers, will, we trust, soon restore peace and harmony in the town and neighbourhood.

On Saturday night one frame was broken in this town; and the following evening four were destroyed at New Radford, one of which was supposed to be the completest silk frame in existence; and, we understand, was then employed in making an order of stockings for the Prince Regent. On this case we are desired by the holder of these frames to state that he had worked in the finest of these frames for twenty years; during which time he has continued to receive the same price, and marked the stockings with the proper marks. On the same night two or three frames were broken at Ruddington, nine of the warp lace kind at Limby, all of great value, and all employed in making the two-course-hole net. At the last mentioned place the people had an expectation that a visit would be paid them, and a number had agreed to watch for the approach of their nocturnal visitors, which they did till midnight, at which time, imagining all the danger was over, they dispersed, and went to their respective homes. This was no sooner done, than the framebreakers made their appearance: fourteen of them entered the house of Mr. Shipley, and in ten minutes completed their work. The damage is estimated at 200*l.* and upwards. On the same night, seven plain cotton frames at Cotmanhay, in the parish of Ilkiston; and, if our information be correct, eleven of the latter description were destroyed at Swanwick: the two latter towns are in Derbyshire.

At ten o'clock this morning we received the disagreeable intelligence, that 22 frames were last night broken at Lenton. About 50 men entered the village, armed in various ways; and while the mischief was going on, every pass in the village was guarded. One man, who was passing with a loaf of bread, was stopped by them, and compelled to stand sentry himself, with a bar of iron in his hand, with an order to give the alarm if any one approached, or otherwise to have his brains blown out. The man who ran to Nottingham to inform the soldiers, had a narrow escape; one of the frame-breakers running after him, vociferating the most horrid vengeance if he caught him. The man escaped, and so did the depredators. The names of the persons at whose houses the frames are broken, with the number at each house, are as follows:- Five at G. Ball's, four of which, he has informed us, were his own property, and were working at full price; eight at Thos. Selby's; one at Wm. Selby's, and pulled the jack-wires out of another two at Jos Shepherd's; one at ——— Taylor's; one at John Barnes's; one at Ann Taylor's; and two at Wm. Burton's. After they had done, they fired three pistols. What adds to the audacity of this affair is, that Lenton, is only about a quarter of a mile from the barracks, and one from Nottingham.

As well as editorial comment, the *Nottingham Journal* also provided a platform for correspondents seeking to explain the causes of the troubles, call the manufacturers to come together to find a solution, and have the mischief makers put to justice.

TO THE PUBLIC.

As there is reason to apprehend, that the calm which we have for a few days enjoyed in this great manufacturing district, is rather a suspension than an entire cessation of outrages; that the perverse mind still exists, though somewhat restrained by power; I venture to express my sentiments, on a subject so interesting to our peace and happiness.

The extensive hostilities in which this country is engaged; and the exclusion of our manufactures from a great part of the Continent of Europe, have so much reduced the consumption of them, as to have occasioned unusual competition in the sale, and a consequent reduction in the price of our articles of commerce. The merchant is induced to endeavour to indemnify himself by manufacturing the goods at a cheaper rate. If the payment to the Manufacturer were not more than a sufficient compensation for his labour before such reduction, he will suffer and complain; and may redress the grievances which he may experience in any peaceable and legal manner. The Hosiery and Lace Manufactures, which have been so extensively established in this and the neighbouring counties, have partaken in the general depression of trade; and the oppression of some, and the daring and felonious conduct of others, have increased the distress, and surrounded us with danger and alarm. It may be well to retrace our steps, to examine what has been done amiss, and to search for a remedy, as calm and impartial spectators, influenced only by a regard to what is fair, honourable, and good.

The Masters dismissed some of their workmen, and they were justified by necessity: some reduced their prices; the act was legal: but it was peculiarly cruel and unkind, at a period when the necessaries of life required an increased expenditure; it was also unavailing, because it was not the objection of price, but the want of demand, which had injured the trade; others took away the rack, an instrument by which the quantity of certain work might be ascertained; it may be presumed, that they required more than was due, as they removed the standard of their just claim. What was necessary, can only be lamented; what was cruel, mut be censured; and what was unjust, must be condemned.

Many of the Manufacturers found out other employments, receiving also reasonable assistance from their parishes, and quietly acquiesced in the deprivation of many of many of their usual comforts: they are to be pitied, and will have their reward in their own approving consciences, and in the season of Final Retribution. Others have required their Masters to manufacture articles, for which they had no demand; have issued threatening letters; have associated in large bodies, and, armed and disguised, have broken into houses, have destroyed stocking and lace frames, filled the country with terror, and, by their felonious conduct, forfeited their lives to the offended laws. They have increased the general misery, by depriving many of their means of employment; and have injured the common labourer by creating for him new competitors. They will probably drive away the trade to remote parts of the kingdom, where men, of better principles and conduct, know and practice their duty to society.

Amidst all this confusion, the Master Manufacturers have been either timid or supine; they have not, as is usual on similar occasions, entered into any subscription; nor in general taken any active measures for preserving their property, or bringing to justice those who injured it.

It appears, then, that the duty of the different orders of society is,— for those employed as Manufacturers to lay aside their unreasonable desire for that work which is not wanted; to deplore the mischief which they have done; and to come to commit outrages and felonies, which defy all decency, law, and religion, place the country in a state of terror; lead to a habit of committing the most atrocious crimes, and must be punished with the heaviest visitation of Justice.

The Master Manufacturers ought not to make unreasonable abatements of wages; the poor and industrious are deserving of their compassion; they are not to be treated with harshness, and cruelty; and all injustice to them must have the indignation of the good, and the anger of heaven.

All, whether rich or poor, are deeply interested in restoring and maintaining the public tranquility. The mischief, if not speedily suppressed, will not confine itself to its present form, but will endanger the lives and property of all. Great numbers have been already deprived of their ordinary means of subsistence by the pretended friends, but truly the bitterest enemies of the lower order of society. It is, therefore, the duty and the interest of all to assist the Civil Power in detecting and apprehending offenders; to support the Magistrates in their exertions to restore tranquillity; to fear no danger in the cause of law and justice, and peace; but boldly to resist such outrages as have a tendency to produce insurrection, anarchy, and the worst of tyranny.

## More of Benjamin Topham's frames are broken

With the Frame Breaking Bill set to pass through Parliament and make frame breaking a capital offence, it seems that impending threat was not yet enough to quell the activities of the frame breakers themselves.

In *Nottingham Journal*, [Saturday 14 March 1812](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002131/18120314/009/0003).

We understand, that not withstanding the pending severities of the law upon the frame-breakers, ten frames were broken and totally demolished, at Pentrich, on Saturday night last; and on Tuesday night last, the iron work of one narrow stocking frame was stolen and completely carried off from a house, situated on the Parson's Flat, at Basford, near this town.
```

They were also nothing if not persistent. For once again, we see them attacking the frames of Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentridge.

The report in the *Leeds Mercury*, which seems to have a been a widely syndicated item, appears to suggest that Topham may have been pressing for those involved in frame breaking to be brought to justice, or perhaps he had been involved in a Jury sitting against them? Whatever the case, it seems that his frames were being targeted again.

The depredations of the Machine-breakers, in the West-Riding of this county, we are sorry to find are still continued. The following is a copy of a letter from our Correspondent at Huddersfield, dated March 12:—

"In the last week, (I think on Thursday night) four houses, near Slaithwaite, were entered by the Luddites, and the frames, shears, &c. destroyed. The name of the owners I have not learned; *indeed, there appears a shyness in speaking on the subject*. Threatening letters have been sent, of which you will soon learn the particulars.

"Last night, the houses of Mr. John Garner, of Honley; Mr. Clement Dyson, Dungeon, and Mr. Roberts, Crosland; were visit by the malcontents, and the obnoxious machinery destroyed. More troops are at this moment entering the town."

"Nottingham, March 9."— Such is the apparent disposition, and systematic conduct of the frame breakers that, if a frame is once marked out for and destruction, its state may be said to be settled, except some step be taken by its possessor to remove the cause assigned for its condemnation; at least such are the conclusions we have a right to draw from what we daily see and hear. It has long formed a topic of conversation, that Mr. B. Topham, of Pentridge, in Derbyshire, had excited the hatred of the *Luddites*, by his activity in attempting to bring some of them to justice, in consequence of several frames being broken in his shop some time ago; and, on Saturday night last, his property became an object of their vengeance; for a party of men entered his dwelling and demolished seven pointnet lace, and three plain hose frames. I am likewise informed, that a man and his wife, who are the chief evidence against a person of the name of *Elliot*, now confined in Derby Gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, likewise felt the effects of their fury; and only escaped with their lives on condition of promising not to swear against the man."
```

In the *London Chronicle*, we learn a few more details of the attack on Topham's frames, and again the implication it was personally motivated, for the work on the machines, as well as the fabric of his house, were damaged, as well as the frames.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS. The Nottingham Papers state, that the Commission of Assize had been opened in the Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bayley, after complimenting the Magistrates on the smallness of the Calendar, observed, that in the two cases of frame-breaking, "that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame breaking only, and no other damage had been done, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage had been done, then the offence was capital." No outrage had been committed by the frame-breakers within the last few days. The ten frames broken yesterday se'nnight, at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, belonging to Mr. Topham, were in full work. The violence appears to have been owing to personal spleen, as the silk and lace pieces about the frames were much injured, his doors and windows all broken to pieces, and his own life menaced, while the violence was committing, by a number of armed men without. Mr. Topham for a short time concealed himself in a closet.

```

Another argument in favour of personal malice being involved in the attack comes from the claim that the frames were being worked "at full price". The following report, which also appeared in several other London papers, recaps on Topham's previous encounters with the Luddites.

Nottingham  
March 13

The Commission of Assize has just been opened in our Shire and Town Halls, and in the latter of which, when the Grand Jury were sworn in, Mr. Justice Bailey addressed them to the following effect:— His Lordship began by complimenting the Magistracy and character of the town, on the smallness of the Calendar, except two cases respecting frame-breaking, and one, connected in some degree with that crime, which was for writing a threatening letter.

On the two former cases, his Lordship observed, that if the house, specified in the Calendar, had been entered with violence, for the purpose of frame-breaking only, *and no other damage had been done*, the crime amounted to simple felony; but if other damage bad been done, then the offence was capital. On the subject of the threatening letter, his Lordship observed, that if the evidence was perfectly clear to their view of the question, then they would find a bill; if not, he hoped they would not find against the Prisoner; as cases of this sort should not be brought before a petty Jury, except on the clearest evidence. At the same time he most strenuously enjoined the Gentlemen of the Jury, equally to lay aside all prejudice against the Prisoner, and all fear, from whatever quarter, for having done their duty.

It has been asserted in the House of Commons by Mr. Wynne, and supported by Mr. John Smith, that the Frame-breaking Bill has already had a bad effect, by partly closing up the channels of private Information against the perpetrators. If this is really the case, what good, we would ask, is to be expected from its influence? for its terrors have not had the effect of stopping the breaking of frames. If, however, these observations should fall into the hands of the misguided men alluded to, we most earnestly hope that they will take a timely hint, and cease from their destructive and dangerous practices. For, independent of the disquietude such conduct must give to every man's mind, who is concerned in it, on account of the danger of detection, most assured we are that its further prosecution will be attended with the most fatal consequences to the future prosperity of this town and neighbourhood. May our solicitations in this respect not be made is vain!

On Saturday night, seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of Benjamin Topham, of that place; and, what makes the case peculiarly distressing is, the lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*l.* each to put them again in working condition. His shop had been twice visited before by the framebreakers; but the first time, they were prevailed upon to desist from all violence; the second time, he was less fortunate, for three lace frames were destroyed belonging to a hosier of this town, and two of his own slightly injured; he having driven them away by ringing a bell in the church, and thereby exciting an alarm. But having noticed, by some means, that his life was threatened, he thought it prudent, on this third attack, to consult his own personal safety, and of course offered no extraordinary obstacle to the exercise of their violence; indeed, while the mischief was going on, he heard his life threatened by many voices. The windows and doors of his house were likewise broken to shivers; and the silk and lace pieces, about the frames, received considerable injury. What frames were at work, were employed on double press net, and at the full price; therefore, the fair conclusion is, that the violence had its origin in personal spleen; which, according to his own declaration, as far as his knowledge goes, has been raised against him without any cause whatsoever. The same night two frames were broken at Losco, about four miles on this side Pentridge; and on Tuesday night, one was carried clean away from Basford.

Fragments of the *Statesman* article also appeared in the *London Chronicle*, along with a report of another attack elsewhere.

DERBYSHIRE RIOTS.— On Saturday night the 7th inst. seven lace and three plain frames were broken at Pentridge, in Derbyshire, which were in the possession of B. TOPHAM, of that place; and, what makes the same peculiarly distressing is, these lace frames were the fruit of his own industry. He calculates, that they will cost him 25*l.* each to put them again in working condition.

On the same night, a man and his wife, at Swanwick, who are expected to be the principle evidences against two persons confined in Derby gaol, on suspicion of frame-breaking, were visited, as it is supposed, by the same party, who assailed their dwelling broke their furniture to pieces, and in some degree injured their persons. They have been removed to Derby as a place of safety. The same night two frames were broken at Losca; and on Tuesday night one was carried away from Basford.

In passing, this paragraph from the *Hampshire Chronicle* estimates the number of frames of various sorts broken to date, along with their typical cost.

It appears that since the commencement of the *Luddite* system, in the neighbourhood of Nottingham, 42 lace-frames, 544 plain silk frames and cotton stocking frames have been destroyed: the value of the former, when new, is, upon the average, about 60l. each; and that of the latter from 18 to 20l. each.
