If Puckaster Cove, on the Isle of Wight, is named after Puck, King of the Fairies, surely there must be a fairy tale to go along with it?

Indeed there is such a fantastical tale, penned by Abraham Elder and published in the pages of Bentley's Miscellany in 1839. It tells of a kidly soul, John Kann, who warns a neighbour not to build on the the fairies' palyground. The fairy-folk are greatful, and one night treat John Kann, magically reduced in size, Alice in Wonderland like, by a pinch of snuff, to a wonderful feast. And also to a secret that will bring him great reward. But what was that secret? And what happened when John Kann told that secret to another?

The original tale is republished here, along a with a more recent retelling of it, and a short historical note on Puckaster Cove.
