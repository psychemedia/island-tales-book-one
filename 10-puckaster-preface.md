# Preface

What's in a name?

John Whitehead's *The Undercliff of the Isle of Wight* (1911) cites volume II of Roach Smith's *Retrospections, Social and Archaeological*, of 1886, as follows:

> *"Puck, Pixies, and Fairies, have left numerous records of their influence over public credulity, and the places named from them are usually associated with remains of antiquity of some kind. Puckaster, or Puckaster Cove, at the back of the Isle of Wight, is one of the localities which has attracted the attention of several writers, and some have been led to imagining that it is of Roman origin. A short time since I had an excellent opportunity of surveying Puckaster. As I approached the site I could see from landslips in remote times the dislocated masses had taken a fantastic form, something like that of a castle or fortified place, and to Puck it had
consequently been assigned."*

According to A. D. Mills' *The Place-names of the Isle of Wight*, the name of Puckaster Cove derives not from the Latin *Port Castra*, but is more likely derived from the Old English words *puca* (from which we get puck), and *torr*, which together give us *“the rock or rocky hill haunted by a goblin"*.

Mills also suggests that the nearby Puckwell Farm, apparently recorded in 1461 as *Pokewell*, derives in part from the Old English *wella*, to give us *“the string or stream haunted by a goblin"*.

If we are to go in search of fairy stories from the Isle of Wight, then — *real* fairy stories — we should, perhaps, start by looking for tales set around the location of Puckaster Cove.

And we should also consult the "honourable" Mr. Abraham Elder, teller of fantastic tales and legends about the Isle of Wight. Consulting the first edition of his book of that same name, *Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight*, published in 1839, we see no reference to any legend of Puckaster Cove, although it does appear in the second edition of 1843 (a copy of this work can be viewed *by appointment* in the Caste Museum library collection at Carisbrooke Castle). The story can also be found in the pages of *Bentley's Miscellany*, a nineteenth literary magazine published under the editorship of a certain Mr Charles Dickens.

Here, then, is that tale re-published, along with my own version of it, originally told as part of the *‘Tis Tales* storytelling set, *Island Tales* at Ventnor Fringe, 2022.
