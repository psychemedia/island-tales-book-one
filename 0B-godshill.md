How did Godshill Church come to be built on top of a hill?

There are many versions of the legend, but Abraham Elder's version, first published in Bentley's Miscellany in 1839, is perhaps the only one that takes the form of a tall tale.

This volume includes Elder's original version, along with a recent retelling of it, descriptions of the legend from "Barber's Picturesque Illustrations of the Isle of Wight", published in 1850, and George Clinch's "The Isle of Wight" of 1908, and a poetical version from Percy G. Stone's *Legends and Lays of the Wight*, first published in 1912. A brief background note regarding the possible identity of Abraham Elder is also provided.
