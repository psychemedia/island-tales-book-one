# Preface

There are many tales that can be told of the Ludding times, captured in contemporary newspaper reports of the time. There are undoubtedly many more that were perhaps never spoken of outside the groups who were directly involved with them, stories that have been lost to time. "Illegal oaths" bound the men together, and it was rare for secrets to be divulged to the authorities, although there are a couple of notable cases where King's evidence was turned.

The events described in this collection of early nineteenth newspaper articles — from the start of the Ludding times in late 1811 and early 1812, and then several years later, at the end of the Luddite era in summer 1816 — describe several attacks upon the knitting frames of Mr. Benjamin Topham, of Pentrich, near Nottingham. The earlier reports provided the basis for one of the tales originally told alongside several protest songs of the period from The AnyWhens (Glenn Koppany and Sue Cain), at Ventnor Fringe in 2025; an early version of that telling of Topham's Tale is also presented here.
