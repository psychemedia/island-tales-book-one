# Preface

Of the particular tales that are most commonly told of the Luddites, arguably two of the most notable, if not *the* most notable, are both set in Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire: the unsuccessful attack on William Cartwright's mill at Rawfolds, in which at least two of the Luddites died, and the murder of another mill-owner, William Horsfall, a few weeks later. Those two events also featured significantly in the trial at York Castle at the start of 1813, and which resulted in the hanging of seventeen men.

By 1817, the Ludding times were at an end. The last of the Luddite trials, for an attack on Heathcoat and Boden's factory in Loughborough in 1816, would be held at the end of Spring, 1817. But whilst not strictly a Luddite trial in the sense of a prosecution mounted against machine-breakers, there would be another trial that same year, 1817, once again held at York Castle. And once again, this trial would feature men arrested in Huddersfield. Whilst it was referred to in some corners of the press as a Luddite trial, *which it wasn't*, and received less attention than the "Pentrich Revolution", *which is was aligned with*, the episode would play an important role in uncovering the machinations of the spy, William Oliver: *the Folly Hall fight*.

In this story note, I have gathered together news reports relating to the Folly Hall fight, and the resulting trial. The tale of the discovery the spy, Oliver, by the Editor of the *Leeds Mercury*, Edward Baines, will be the focus of another storynote. The tale of the Pentrich revolution will also form the basis of another note.

This storynote also includes an early version of my own first attempt at a telling of the Folly Hall affair intercut it with a brief tale of the Nottingham Captain and the events at Pentrich, as well as contrasting the management of the two trials, as well as their outcomes.
