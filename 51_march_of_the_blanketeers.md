# The Blanketeers — Attempted Tellings

The following was my first attempt at a version of the Blanketeers' story told  tongue-in-cheek in the style of a traditional fairy tale, and based on the principle that the story is what's left when the facts have been forgotten. It doesnlt really work, but as a quick experiment, it was fin to try, and might be worth considereing again as I get to know the sotry better...

> Once, there was a King; a *mad* King; the King was so infirm that his son, the Prince, ruled in his place; but the prince liked to drink, and the prince liked to party; and the prince was a profligate, and the prince just had to have those beatiful shoes, and that fabulous jacket. In short, the prince was a full time fasshion victim playboy. With terrible taste. And so, the King's Ministers ran the country instead.
>
> For a long time, the kingdom had been fighting many wars, and even though the wars were over now, the people were still very poor. And their discontent lead to angry mobs and riots.
>
> Although the country had laws, the Ministers were fearful of revolt, so they did all they could to make it easier to arrest people first, and ask questions later.
>
> This did not go down well with common people in the kingdom.
>
> Far away from the city where the King and Prince lived, along with all the Ministers, but still within the kingdom, was another city. To walk from one to the other could take a week or more to walk — this is once, remember, and not everyone had a horse — and that was if you were a good walker.
>
> One day, the people in the second city heard that a great mass of barbarians from the wastelands of the North were on a long march to the capital to complain to the King — or the Prince, or the Ministers, or to anyone who would listen, about how downtrodden they were.
>
> There weren't really any barbarian hoard, but it got the people thinking. Maybe they could petition the Prince about the taxes they had to pay, the poor wages they received, the dire poverty in which they lived. Maybe they could persuade him to stop the Ministers taking the law into their own hands (they knew the King was mad, so it was pointless going to see him). And maybe they could lobby him for a Parliament that represented the common people, "them that hasn't", rather than the Lords and Ladies and just "them that has".
>
> So they had a meeting, and some of the men stood on a cart and gave a rousing speech to the crowd. And they decided they would march to the city where the Prince lived, up to a week's walk away, to petition him.
>
> Now the people knew that the Ministers had no love for the poor people, and nor did the local Magistrates, dirty smelly rabble that they were — the people, that is, not the Magistrates: they probably smelled beautiful and probably had a bath at least once a month — and they knew that the soldiers would be set on them if they looked like a mob.
>
> So they were clever; they would gather together in small groups of ten people or so, with a separate copy of the petition for each group, or even each person, even if that meant each petition only had a few names on it, or even just one name on it, and they would march in small groups, because nobody could argue with that.
>
> Because the journey was long one, they would each take a blanket, to keep them warm at night as they'd have to camp under the stars; the one with petitions would pin them to the blanket, as a badge, to show their intention; and everyone who wasn't going on the march would raise what little money they could so the marchers could buy some small amount of food each day.
>
> So one morning, the people began to gather; thousands of them; a thousand or so set off on the march, "their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with a skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, had large bundles attached to their shoulders" as if they were soldiers, and leaving the rest to their speeches and fundraising.
>
> As emotions started to get heated in the crowd, in came the army, and arrested the ringleaders.
>
> And then they went after the marchers, who were expecting their leaders to catch up with them later that day with the money to support them.
>
> (As it was, I've heard it tell that the purseman with a pretty penny in funds to pay for food and accommodation along the way got lost himself, and only returned when all the money had been spent!)
>
> The soldiers came along on their horses, with swords and sabers and who knows what, and the marchers — well, a blanket didn't work so well as armour, so it's not hard to work out who came off worst.
>
> Some of the marchers were split up and sent this way, others were sent that way, and several hundred found themselves in jail for the night.
>
> The leaders of the march were given special treatment, imprisoned, and given a day in court. Their witnesses were made ready, and then: nothing; back to prison they went.
>
> The Ministers reacted in style, pushing through a law that banned unapproved gatherings of more than fifty people
>
> Several weeks later, a Special Jury was laid on. But when the time came to present the case before the Judge, on charges that included "begging", because the marchers hadn't actually done anything wrong — they had broken no law, and this was a land that was supposedly ruled by law — the lawyer for the prosecution just muttered something about it all being peaceful now, and there was no need to charge the men, so he wouldn't offer any evidence against them.
>
> And so they went free.
>
> As to the march to petition the Prince, it is said that one man, and one man only, actually made it to the city where the Prince lived. Maybe he got lost and didn't realise he was on his own. Who knows?
>
> But what I do know is that this is a true story.
>
> Once, was 1817, and the kingdom was Great Britain. The mad King was King George III, and the Prince was the playboy Prince Regent, later George IV. The Ministers, well, they were Lord Liverpool's Tory Government. And the marchers? They were men from Manchester — The Blanketeers — who set off to march to London in March, 1817, from their original gathering point in St Peter's Field, the scene of the Peterloo massacre two years later. Following the march, the Seditious Meetings Act of 1817 was passed, that banned unapproved gatherings of more than 50 people that would deliberate on grievances against the Church or State, and could lead to a capital death sentence for the organisers.

Rather than simply throw that version completely away and start again, I changed tone and did a quick iteration of it:

> It was the end of the Ludding times, and the time of growing calls for Parliamentary reform. In Manchester, despite being a growing metropolis, there was Parliamentary representation. And the people there were not happy about that, not happy at all. There were rumours that folk in Scotland were similarly minded, and that a march had started that was going to make its way to London to take *their* protest directly to Government. No more faffing about with letters: a demand for change from the people themselves. A barbarian hoard on the rampage, demonstrating their discntent in a way that could not be ignored.
> 
> Or perhaps not.
> 
> But it got the people thinking. Maybe they could petition the Prince about the taxes they had to pay, the poor wages they received, the dire poverty in which they lived.
> 
> Maybe *they* could persuade him to stop the Ministers taking the law into their own hands (they knew the King was mad, so it was pointless going to see him). And maybe *they* could lobby the Prince for a Parliament that represented the common people, "them that hasn't", rather than the Lords and Ladies and just "them that has".
> 
> So they had a meeting. And there was standing on carts, and rousing speeches, and they decided they *would* march to London, a week's walk away, and petition him themselves.
> 
> They all knew that the Ministers had no love for poor folk like themselves, of course. And neither did the local Magistrates, dirty smelly rabble that they were — the people, that is, not the Magistrates: they probably smelled beautiful and probably had a bath at least once a month —  and everyone knew that the soldiers would as likely as not be set on them if they looked like a mob.
> 
> So they were a bit more clever about it: the word on the street was that if you only gathered in small groups of not more ten people or so, with a separate copy of the petition for each group, or even each person, even if that meant each petition only had a few names on it, or even just one name on it, then there was nothing the dsoldiers could do to stop you. So they would march in small groups, exaclty like that, because then nobody could argue with them.
> 
> The journey would be a long one, though: a hundred and fifty miles or more, so several days walk, and several nights where they'd have to find and make camp. So they'd each take a blanket; and as a badge, by way of marking out their cause, the petitions would be pinned to the blankets; and for everyone who wasn't going on the march? Well, they would raise what little money they could so the marchers could buy some small amount of food each day.
> 
> The date was agreed, and the people began to gather; at Petersfield, (you might have heard of it); thousands of them. A thousand or so set off on the march, "their bed blankets thrown over their shoulders, and fastened in front, over the breast, with a skewer. They were in full marching order; those who could not procure knapsacks or haversacks, had large bundles attached to their shoulders" as if they were soldiers, and leaving the rest to their speeches and fundraising.
> 
> Back at Petersfield, emotions started to get heated in the crowd. The army came in. The ringleaders were arrested. And the crowd.... By now, some of you may be thinking: and now the troops rode in, with their sabres swinging, and their swords stabbing, and there was the massacre, the famous Peterloo massacre. But this wasn't then — that was a couple of years later, and another story for another day.
> 
> Becuase for now, in this time, in this story, the troops turned instead, and went after the marchers.
> 
> They had been expecting their leaders to catch up with them later in the day, along with the money colection they need to support them and pay their way as they marched south.
> 
> Instaed, the soldiers came along, on their horses, with swords and sabers and who knows what, and the marchers — well, a blanket didn't work so well as armour, so it's not hard to work out who came off worst.
> 
> Some of the marchers were split up and sent this way, others were sent that way, and several hundred found themselves in jail for several nights, before being released.
> 
> The leaders of the march were imprisoned, and treated to a court appearance. All manner of witnesses for the defence made themselves ready to appear as well, but then: nothing; so back to prison the ringleaders went.
> 
> In London, the Ministers reacted in typical style. Then, as now, they considered one of the best ways to suppress popular discontent was to ban it, so they pushed through a law that banned unapproved gatherings of more than fifty people.
> 
> It was several weeks before a Special Jury was laid on for the trial of the ringleaders. But when the time came to present the case before the Judge, on charges that included "begging", because the marchers hadn't actually done anything wrong — they had broken no law, and this was a land that was supposedly ruled by law — the lawyer for the prosecution just muttered something about it all being peaceful now, and there was no need to charge the men, so he wouldn't offer any evidence against them.
> 
> And so they went free.
> 
> At this point, you may be wondering what happened to the "purseman", who had been charged with bringing the money collected at the meeting to help pay the way — for the food and the accommodation — of the petitioners as thy went alonfg the march?
> 
> Well, the story as I've heard it tell, was that a pretty penny in funds was raised. But that when he'd set off to catch up with the marchers, he'd taken a wrong turn and got lost. And only returned when the money had been spent...
> 
> As to whether anyone actually made it to London, to petition the Prince, it's said that just one man did. That maybe he sat on a bench, to wait. And is maybe waiting there still...

As I get to know the story better, I think this, rather than the fairy tale style telling, is the route I will go... though it may be fun to return to the land of *Once* with it again at some point...
