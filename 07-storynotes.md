# Other Storynotes collections


As well as the short storynotes included in this collection, I am also collating more significant story collections on specific incidents or matters of history with an Isle of Wight theme.

On the Loss of the Eurydice: HMS Eurydice foundered off Dunnose point in 1878. This collection includes contemporary news reports and memorial poems, as well as short asides on the building of Sandown pier and reclamation of Brading harbour, both of which were works in progress at the time.

On the Trail of the Sin Eater: pursuing a 19th century correspodence debate regarding the Welsh tradition — or not! — of the sin-eater;

Story Notes — Technical Recipes: developing a range of search tools over traditional stories and story types.
