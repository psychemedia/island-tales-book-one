# Afterword

If you do make it up to the Church, and browse the noticeboard there, you're as likely as not to see a poster for a flower festival, or a jumble sale, perhaps, as well as sundry other church notices.

But for one visitor, John Hassell, writing in the second volume of his two volume work, *Tour of the Isle of Wight*, published in 1790, and which you can find nowadays in the Castle Museum library (*by appointment*) at Carisbrooke Castle, or via the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_tour-of-the-isle-of-wigh_hassell-j_1790_2/page/n121/mode/2up?), there was something rather more unusual posted there. After noting damage to two of the gable ends resulting from the 1178 lightning strike, Hassell recounts his experience of entering the Church (p.88): *[u]pon our entering the porch we observed abstracts from several acts of parliament fixed against the door, and among them one that excited both our curiosity and risibility;*

> â€” it was from an act made in the seventh of James the First, which enacts, that every female who unfortunately intrudes on the parish a second illegitimate child, shall be liable to imprisonment and hard labour in Bridewell for six months.
>  
> Now as the number of females on this island much exceeds that of the males; and as, from the mild temperature of the climate, circumstances frequently arise among the lower ranks that render the intention of this act of no effect; we could not help thinking this public exhibition of the abstract as rather a rigorous exertion of Justice.
>
> We found it was not very unusual here for the young men, from the deficiency of numbers just spoken of, to pay their devoirs to more than one young woman at a time; and as it is not possible for him legally to unite himself to all of them, he generally bestows his hand on her who had first presented him with a pledge of their love.
>  
> This, however, is seldom done till the approach of a second pledge from the same person renders such an act of compassion needful, in order to avoid the consequences of the tremendous anathema fixed on the church door.
