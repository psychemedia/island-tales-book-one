# And so it begins

At the start of 1811, there was dissent in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, and the pressure was on to try to reduce the costs of lace and hose manufacture. The prices per piece were fixed, but it seems that some manufacturers were looking to find ways around the traditional pricing, to the detriment of the people who worked for them, whilst others, or so it seemed, sought to do right by their workers.

Outbreaks of machine breaking in the Spring of 1811 had abated that summer when the workers came to an agreement with the manufacturers, but following another poor harvest, and increases in the price of food that were hard to bear, the machine-breaking had flared up again in November. At one point it looked like some accommodation may have been made to quell the violence, but it was a false hope.

Nottingham, Friday, Dec. 13.

...

Since the publication of the resolution agreed to at a meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers held on the 4th inst. the excesses of the frame-breakers have been considerably more limited, and every thing has again assumed the appearance of returning tranquillity in the vicinity of this town. We have heard of only three instances of the destruction of frames since our last, viz. 6 at Bullwell, and 4 at Arnold, on Saturday night last; and at Burton Joyce, on Wednesday night. No violence whatever, we are happy to say, has been offered to the property of the Hosiers, in this town, during the last ten days.— Another meeting of the gentlemen concerned in the manufacture of Hosiery and Lace, took place this morning, at Thursland Hall, which was very numerously attended. The result of the meeting had not transpired when this paper was put to press.

Whilst the *Nottingham Journal* of December 14th, 1811, was hopeful that matters in Nottingham were coming to some sort of resolution, the same edition also reported a series of attacks in Derbyshire. Two visits to a certain Mr. B. Topham of Pentridge are also recorded, and his encounters with the miscreants are surely worth a story.

DERBY Dec. 11. It is with extreme regret we state to our readers that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in Nottinghamshire, have extended into our own county. We understand that the town of Ilkeston, and the villages of Makeney, Heage, Holbrook, Crich, &c., have suffered considerably from the visits of the Frame-Breakers, the particulars of which we have not been able to learn, but are informed, from the best authority, that frames of all descriptions have been destroyed, without discrimination. From the following account, which we have received from a correspondent, it appears that at Pentrich and the neighbourhood, their proceedings have been most destructive: soon after midnight, on the 1st instant, the Frame-Breakers, armed with weapons, arrived at Pentrich, and proceeded to the house of Mr B. Topham; knocking at the door, they demanded the key of his workshop, and a light. On opening the door, they presented three guns at him, threatening to blow his brains out if he did not comply with their demands: he told them he had no frames of the description they were in search of (for cut-up work), nor were there any in the town; and having somewhat appeased them by conciliatory language, they left his house, one of them cursing the man who had sent them thither. After going to a few more shops in the village, they departed, without doing any mischief, but threatening to return some future night and demolish those frames that were worked at an under price, or by those persons who are termed *Colts*. Accordingly, on the following evening, the neighbourhood was again visited by them, but on finding that the prices had been raised, they were satisfied without breaking any frames, excepting one at Oakenthorpe, one at South Wingfield Park, and one at Wessington. On Saturday night the seventh, about the hour of twelve, with most destructive purpose they came again to Pentrich, and literally broke into shivers ten stocking frames, and also two lace frames, notwithstanding full prices have been given. The two lace frames were worked by Mr. Topham, who, as the mob were entering his shop, chanced to be at a short distance from his house, on his return from Nottingham, and learning what was going forward, with much presence of mind ran to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and began to ring the bells; on hearing which the rioters were alarmed and precipitately retreated. They afterwards demolished a frame a short distance from the village, and proceeded to Swanwick, where they broke three frames, and also two at Riddings, both near Alfreton. At Ilkeston, about thirty frames have been injured in the course of the week.

The most prompt and vigilant measures have been adopted by the Magistrates for the county to suppress these alarming proceedings, and restore the public tranquility, which we trust will be speedily effected.— On Monday, the Derby and Chaddesden Troops of Yeomanry Cavalry were ordered to assemble here on duty, and mustered in the evening with the greatest alacrity; and yesterday they were joined by the Radborne troop. They have been engaged in the whole of the last nights in different divisions, protecting the neighbouring villages and places where the most apprehension was entertained. The Derby and Chaddesden troops were relieved from duty this afternoon, by the arrival of a troop of Scots Greys from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here until further orders. —*Derby Mercury*.
```

As the mischief stepped up in Derbyshire, a delegation had been sent to London, perhaps in recognition that the current troubles could not be properly addressed by purely local measures. Meanwhile, the militia chased false or outdated rumours, and Nedd Ludd was writing warning letters to the manufacturers.

```{admonition} A deputation to London, December 1811
:class: dropdown
In *Nottingham Review*, [Friday 13 December 1811](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18111213/032/0004).

The alarm occasioned by the insurrectional conduct of the frame-breakers, had taken such deep-root in the minds of the manufacturers, that on Friday last, a deputation of them arrived in London, to lay the state of the town and county before government, in consequence whereof, a magistrate from Bow-street and several police officers, appeared in this town a few days after; but we have not heard of any additional activity being displayed on that account, as indeed that would almost seem impossible; the magistrates both of the town and county having exerted every nerve of the civil authority previous to the arrival of the watchful strangers. And we have every reason to believe, that the conciliatory measures proposed by the manufacturers, in inviting the workmen to lay their complaints before them, *after the peace of the town and the county should have been restored*, have had a greater effect in allaying the commotions than any measures adopted by the civil and military authorities could have produced. Indeed, so cautious, so determined, and so systematic in their operations were the rioters become, that the exertions both of the soldiers (whose orderly conduct and clemency have excited general admiration) and the civil power were almost unavailing.

In our own immediate vicinity, the only mischief we have heard of being done, since our last, is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. The mischief has been more extensive in Derbyshire, for, on Friday night last, seven frames were broken at Holbrook, and on Saturday night, at Pentridge and its neighbourhood, eighteen were broken; and, though we have not learnt the number, we have been informed that several were destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason which has been publicly circulated, for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that some one hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that the destructive visit was to deter him from so doing. Among the number, two lace frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own was slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of him going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.

On Sunday, the Berkshire militia arrived in this town, in twenty-four waggons, on their route from Ipswich, and on their arrival, they neither found the town half burnt down, nor any symptoms thereof, the local militia driven away by the rioters, nor the Mayor and fifteen of the hussars murdered in the streets, as they had been informed on the road. Such an active agent is *rumour*, that if *caution* does not attend at his heels, he would soon cause a belief that half the kingdom was in flames. As a precautionary measure, the Berkshire militia are principally stationed in the neighbouring villages; and the Southwell locals have been dismissed to their respective homes, with an excellent character for their good conduct. On the last mentioned day, a report was spread here, that the flame of discord was making rapid advances at Loughborough; and a troop of hussars were summoned from hearing divine service in one of our churches, and immediately dispatched to that town; they, however, and the public, were agreeably disappointed, for Loughborough and its neighbourhood were in peace. A considerable quantity of posts and rails, belonging to a gentleman in that vicinity, had been set fire to a night or two before, but even the supposed motive for the commission of such a daring outrage, we have not been made acquainted with.

Measures of precaution for the protection of property continue to be taken both in this town and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton's hall in particular, where the arms belonging to the late Wollaton and Lenton Volunteers are deposited, has been protected by a strong guard for seventeen successive nights, for fear those arms should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal for assistance from our barracks, in case of an alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself: the workmen in the various branches of the framework-knitting trade, are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices; the latter, we are happy to hear, lend a favorable ear to such solicitations, and we understand are this day holding a meeting at the Exchange-Hall, to take the business into consideration; and the magistrates laudably interest themselves in furthering the work of conciliation.

After flattering ourselves with these favorable appearances, it is doubly painful to have to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw, and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, Flour-seller, in this town, were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part was saved.

We are credibly informed, that yesterday afternoon, a frame was broken at Burton, in this county. The depredators escaped detection, though there are parties both of horse and foot soldiers in the village.

At the moment our paper was going to press, a meeting of an extraordinary nature was sitting at the Shire Hall, as we understand, for the purpose of taking into consideration the alarming state of the county, of hearing complaints, and examining into means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority. There were present, His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the County), Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &c. and the Magistracy of the County.

Committed on Wednesday the 11th instant, for trial at the Assizes, by Edward Swann and Wright Coldham, Gentlemen, Aldermen, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, Lace-manufacturer, upon the oaths of Rupert Renshaw and others, with feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed with a ficticious name, viz. "*Ned Lud and Co.*" and directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. Park-street, Nottingham, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and injure his person, and the person of Thomas Clarke, a person concerned in such manufacture.

And on the same day, by the same Magistrates, William Parkes, and George Shaw, upon the oath of Joseph Allen and others, with entering a dwelling house in this town, on the 25th of November, and breaking five stocking frames contrary to Statute.

In addition to the military force now stationed here, we understand that two troops of the Oxford Blues, commanded by Captain Fenwick, are on their march from Reading to this town, by forced marches.

Communications were also starting to appear in the national (which is to say, London) press with letters from correspondents passing on the news previously reported in the regional papers variously recombined.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS

We have received letters and papers from Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester, our extracts from which shew, that the disturbances which first broke out in the county of Nottingham, are extending with alarming rapidity to the neighbouring counties. Nottingham, where we were led to believe that all disputes between the manufacturers and their employers were in a train of accommodation, the turbulent spirit of the rioters, encouraged long impunity, is manifested in the acts of incendiaries; in the county of Derby, the number of frames broken within the last eight days exceed 110; and in Leicester, we fear, we shall soon have to record similar acts of violence. Government, we understand, wished in the instance to leave the suppression'of these disturbances to the magistracy, who, with the military, have, throughout, been alike active and indefatigable; but it must be evident that the rioters are too well organised, act too systematically, and receive too correct information, to be suppressed without other aids.

LEICESTER, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. Rumours are in circulation here, that a party of frame-breakers have visited one or two villages in our vicinity: but the extent of the damage, or whether any, is not known. Our yeomanry have been on duty for some days past. The King's Guards (Blues) arrived yesterday morning; and the Cumberland Militia have been ordered thither from Cambridge.

DERBY, THURSDAY, DEC. 12. It is with extreme regret we state, that the disturbances which have caused so much agitation in a neighbouring county, have broken out here with destructive violence: At Holbrook, Crich, Heage, and Pentridge, not fewer than between 40 and 50 frames, of all descriptions, have been broken since Saturday last. A party of these deluded men visited Pentridge thrice in one night (the 1st inst.) not finding the frames they were in search of at Mr. Topham's, they departed without doing any mischief, but giving caution to the people not work at an under price, nor encourage colts among them, threatening otherwise they would return and demolish their frames. On the second visit they were pacified at finding that the prices had been raised, and contented themselves with demolishing three frames at Oakerthorpe, &c. On Saturday night they returned and broke twelve frames, notwithstanding full prices having been given. Two of the lace frames belonged to Mr. Topham, who, not being at home on their arrival, but learning what was going forward, ran with great presence of mind to the vicarage house, and having obtained the key of the church, proceeded thither, and began to ring the bells; hearing which the rioters were alarmed, and precipitately retired. They afterwards demolished several frames at Swanwick, Riddings, and Ripley. At Ilkeston about 30 frames have been injured in the course of the week. The reason which has been circulated for the frame breakers again visiting Pentridge, is, that one hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames to the village, and that the destructive visit was to deter him from so doing. Measures have been adopted to prevent arms falling into the hands of the rioters, and the Derby and Chadderton yeomanry cavalry have been called out. A troop of Scots Greys has also arrived from Nottingham, which is to be stationed here. The military are authorised to act in case of falling in with the rioters.

NOTTINGHAM, FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DEC. 13. We had flattered ourselves that the publication of the Resolution agreed to at a Meeting of the Hosiers and Lace Manufacturers would have caused the frame-breakers to suspend their destructive proceedings throughout the county; but though no act of violence has occurred in this town for the last ten days, they have not ceased elsewhere. At Bulwell and Arnold ten frames wore broken on Saturday Sunday, and two at Baston Joyce on Wednesday night.

Three o'clock. —After flattering ourselves with the hopes of approaching tranquillity, it is doubly painful to record new acts of aggression, and these too of the most desperate kind. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, flour-seller in this town, were last night set fire to at Basford; the former was entirely consumed; and of the latter only a small part was saved.—At this moment an extraordinary meeting is sitting at the Shire Hall, consisting of the Duke of Newcastle, (Lord Lieutenant of the county) Viscount Newark, Sir J. B. Warres, Sir T. W. White, and the Magistrates, to take into consideration the alarming and destructive state of the county, to receive informations, and to endeavour to ascertain the means by which the rioters support themselves in the exercise of their lawless authority.

NOTTINGHAM RIOTS

The latest accounts received from Nottingham state, that in the immediate vicinity, the only mischief recently done is one frame destroyed at Basford, three at Hucknall Torkard, four at Arnold, and five at Bulwell. It has been more extensive in Derbyshire; for on Saturday se'nnight, near Pentridge, 18 frames were broken and several destroyed at Ripley on Wednesday night. The reason publicly circulated for the frame-breakers again visiting Pentridge is, that some hosier had intimated his intention of fetching the whole of his frames from the village, and that their visit was to deter him. Two lace-frames at the house of Mr. B. Topham were destroyed, and one of his own slightly injured, on account, as is supposed, of his going to the church, and ringing the bells to alarm the village.

Precautions for the protection of property continue both at Nottingham and the surrounding villages: Lord Middleton's Hall, where arms are deposited has been guarded for 17 successive nights, lest they should fall into the hands of the rioters; and a tar tub is placed at the top of the hall, to set fire to, as a signal, in case of alarm. The fairest prospect, however, for returning peace, presents itself; the Workmen in the frame-work knitting-trade are active in soliciting the manufacturers for a redress of grievances, and a concordancy in prices; the latter lend a favourable ear to such solicitations, and we understand on Friday held a meeting at the Exchange-hall, on the subject.—After such favourable appearances, it is painful to record new aggressions. Two stacks, one of straw and the other of corn, belonging to Mr. Pepper, were on Friday night set fire to at Basford, the former entirely consumed, and of the latter only a small part saved.

We are informed, that on Thursday a frame was broken at Burton. The depredators escaped detection, though horse and foot soldiers were in the village.

An extraordinary meeting sat at the Shire Hall on Friday, to consider the state of the country, to hear complaints, and to examine into the means by which the rioters support themselves. There were present the Duke of Newcastle, Viscount Newark, Sir J. Warren, Bart. Sir Thomas Wollaston White, &c., and the Magistracy of the county.

Wednesday, the 11th inst. was committed for trial at the Assizes, John Ingham, a workman employed by Mr. Wm. Nunn, lace manufacturer, for feloniously writing and sending a letter, signed "Ned Lud and Co." directed to Wm. Nunn and Co. threatening break and destroy their frames, and injure his person and that of T. Clarke, concerned in such manufacture. The appearance of the rioters was feared at Leicester.

To the north as well, Edward Baines, of the *Leeds Mercury*, was maintaining a watching brief on the affairs to the south, and trying to place the events into some sort of historical context.

In *Leeds Mercury*, [Saturday 21 December 1811](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000076/18111221/008/0003).

Nottingham, Dec. 12— The insurrectional state to which this county has been reduced for the last month, has no parallel in history, since the troubled days of Charles the First, against which misguided Monarch it took so decided a part. Day after day have the Magistrates, both of the town and county, used every possible endeavour to restore tranquility; day after day have they added to the strength and activity of the civil powers, and called in additional aid of the military; but hitherto, their exertions have been but of little avail; a mysterious organization has been brought into existence, which baffles every ordinary effort to suppress it. — The rioters appear suddenly, in armed parties, under regular commanders; the chief of who, being whomsoever he may, is stiled *General Ludd*, and his orders are as implicitly obeyed as if he had received his authority from the hands of the Monarch. Indeed it is well understood, that disobedience to his commands is punishable with death, according to a solemn oath administered to all the party; and any person that gives information against any of them, subjects himself to the vengeance of the whole organized band, both in person and property; some dreadful examples in the latter instance having already being inflicted, by the burning of haystacks, &c.; hence it is that so few impeachments are made, and so few of the depredators apprehended.

The following article, on the same subject, is from the *Statesman* Newspaper, and is of so alarming a complexion as to induce a hope that there is some degree of exaggeration:—

*December 15*— There are 20,000 stocking-makers out of employment. Six regiments of soldiers from different parts of the country have been sent into this town; and 300 new constables have been sworn in to keep the peace. But all this is of no avail as the practice of setting fire to corn and hay stacks, and breaking open houses still continues. Nine Hundred Lace Frames have been broken, which cost £140 each; from twenty to thirty of them are destroyed in a night. The whole country, for twenty miles around, is full of these ruinous proceedings, nor can they be checked, Nottingham gaol is full of debtors; and the country is equally distressed. no trade; no money. This has been the case for two months. This town is now a garrison, and strictly under martial law. God only knows what will be the end of it; nothing but ruin. 

Later accounts down to the 18th inst. state that no advantage has resulted from the expected Meeting of the manufacturers, but that the parties broke up without coming to any decision.

Finally, with Christmas approaching, it seems as if the Magistrates and their military support were starting to make some headway in making arrests.

THE RlOTS.— Notwithstanding the extreme vigilance of the civil and military powers in Nottingham and its neighbourhood, depredations (though we are happy to say in a lesser degree) still continue to be committed.— The utmost measures of precaution, security, and conciliation are taken, and we anxiously look forward to a speedy adjustment of the existing misunderstanding.

On Saturday night a man was escorted to Leicester goal (*sic*) by a party of light horse, for breaking a stocking frame in the neighbourhood of Loughborough; — since that time no fresh outrages have been committed in Leicestershire.

Committals to Nottingham town gaol:— W. S. Parkes, and George Shaw, to take their trials at the next assizes, on a charge of entering by force into a dwelling-house, situate in the parish of St. Mary, Nottingham, on the night of the 25th day of November last, and therein feloniously breaking five stocking-frames; —also John Ingham, charged on the oaths of Rupert Renshaw, and others, with feloniously writing, or causing to be written, and sending, on the 13th day of November last, a letter, signed with a fictitious name, addressed to Nunn and Co. of Nottingham, threatening to break and destroy the frames of the said Wm. Nunn, and to injure his person, and the person of Thos. Clarke, for not complying with certain demands, claims, and pretences of him the said John Ingham, and of certain other workmen of him the said Nunn.— Committed the county gaol:— George Paley, charged upon the oaths of Joseph Smithhurst, and others, with feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously breaking and destroying, on the 19th of November last, at Sutton in Ashfield, a certain frame used in the making of frame-work-knitted pieces, the property of Francis Betts, of Sutton in Ashfield aforesaid.

And in a further attempt to guarantee the peace, in a Royal Proclamation of December 18th, 1811, the Prince Regent set up a game of Prisoner's Dilemma, by offering a reward of £50 per person convicted, for information leading to their arrest of anyone involved in the outrages, plus a pardon if the informer had been engaged in those activities themselves.

A PROCLAMATION.

WHEREAS it has been represented that a considerable Number of disorderly Persons, chiefly composed of Stockingers, or Persons employed in the Stocking Manufactories, have for some Time past assembled themselves together in a riotous and tumultuous Manner, in the Town and County of the Town of Nottingham, and likewise in several Parts of the Counties of Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester; and, for the Purpose of compelling their Employers to comply with certain Regulations prescribed by themselves, with respect to Work, and the Wages to be paid for the same, have had Recourse to Measures of Force and Violence, and have actually committed various Acts of Outrage in different Parts of the Counties abovementioned, whereby the Property of many of His Majesty's good Subjects has, in several instances, been wholly destroyed, and their Lives and Properties are still greatly endangered: We, therefore, acting in the Name and on behalf of His Majesty, being duly sensible of the mischievous Consequences which must inevitably ensue, as well to the Peace of the Kingdom as to the Lives and Properties of His Majesty's Subjects, from such wicked and illegal Practices if they go unpunished, and being firmly resolved to cause the Laws to be put in Execution for the Punishment of such Offenders, have thought fit, by the Advice of the Privy Council, to issue this Proclamation, hereby strictly commanding all Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, and all other Civil Officers whatsoever, within the said Town and County of the Town of Nottingham, and the said Counties of Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester respectively, that they do use their utmost Endeavours to discover, apprehend, and bring to Justice the Persons concerned in the Riotous Proceedings above mentioned: And as a further Inducement to discover the said Offenders, We do hereby, acting as aforesaid, promise and declare, that any Person or Persons who shall discover and apprehend, or cause to be discovered and apprehended, the Authors, Abettors, or Perpetrators of any of the Outrages above-mentioned, so that they, or any of them, may be duly convicted thereof, shall be entitled to the Sum of FIFTY POUNDS for each and every Person who shall be so convicted, and shall also receive His Majesty's most Gracious Pardon for the said Offence, in case the Person making such Discovery as aforesaid shall be liable to be prosecuted for the same: And the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury are hereby required to make Payments accordingly of the said Reward.

Perhaps taking inspiration from the apparent ease with which the frame breakers were apparently getting away with their attacks, at least for the most part, it seems as if others saw an opportunity for more nefarious, personal gain.

In *Nottingham Journal*, [Saturday 28 December 1811](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0002131/18111228/012/0003?browse=true).

It is with great concern we have to communicate the intelligence, that the 'deluded men,' who, under the title of *"Ned Lud's men,"* carried on for the last nine months, their depredations on the property of the persons employed in the manufactory of this part of the country, have in the county of Derby commenced their attacks on a different description of persons, as well as a different species of property; though it is nothing more than could be expected, when the desperate men, such as the above must be, have been enabled for so great a length of time to exist in a state of warfare against property, and in the very centre of the kingdom; for if these men are to carry their point, he must be a very short-sighted man indeed who cannot foresee, that they will not confine themselves to the attack of any one sort of property. — A few nights since a farm house was broken into at Stanley, in the county of Derby, by armed men, and stripped of the money and all the linen they could carry away; and on Saturday night last the farm house at Locko Grange, in the same neighbourhood, was entered by two men, armed with pistols. The family were all gone to bed, except the farmer's son. One of the miscreants presented a pistol at his head, which he snatched from him; and the other directly pointed his pistol at him, but it fortunately only snapped. The family were alarmed at the noise, and one of them coming down, the villains made off, and unfortunately escaped. The young man who made so resolute a resistance, is, we understand, much hurt in the scuffle he had with the ruffians.—But the most daring attack that we have heard of, took place in the neighbourhood of Hopwell and Ockbrook, in the same part of the country, not far from Hopwell Hall; a farm house, occupied by a person who is a farmer and miller, was attacked on Monday morning, about three o'clock, by 11 or 12 men, armed with pistols and bludgeons, who at first said, they only wanted the man to sign a paper respecting the price of corn, as their families were starving; he would not open his door to them, which, however, they immediately forced open themselves with great violence. The farmer defended the stair-case with his gun as long as he could, his wife giving the alarm at the window; but a large stone thrown at her by one of the ruffians, which cut her lip asunder, soon made her desist. The farmer being overpowered, they took away his gun, and he with difficulty prevailed upon them to spare his life. They swore their families should not starve, whilst money was to be had, and immediately rifled the house, taking away £37. in money. They called themselves "Lud's men," and said *"that was only a beginning!"*

We cannot but indulge a hope that these accounts may be somewhat exaggerated, which may be easily accounted for, from the state of alarm many parts of the country labour under; but we have heard them from so respectable a quarter, that we think it a duty to communicate them to the public, that persons whose lives or property are in danger, may have the opportunity of taking the necessary precautions for their own safety.

Several frames have been broken since our last, notwithstanding the issuing of his Majesty's Proclamation, and in open defiance of the measures adopted by the Corporate Body and the Magistracy, viz. 2 in North Street, in this town, and 6 in the parishes of Radford and Arnold.

In *Northampton Mercury*, [Saturday 28 December 1811](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000317/18111228/008/0003).

Derby, December 25.—We last week congratulated our readers on the re-appearance of tranquillity among the frame-work-knitters, and we have not heard that it has since suffered any interruption; but we lament to state, that since our last, the neighbourhood has been alarmed by events of a still more violent and atrocious nature.—On Sunday evening, about eight o'clock, the house of Mr. Brentnall, of Locko Grange, near this place, was violently attacked by a band of villains consisting of eight or more persons; two of them with their faces blacked, and armed with pistols, entered the house.—Mr. Brentnall and part of his family were retired to rest, but being alarmed by the noise, he hastened down stairs and found his son engaged in opposing the ruffians. By their united exertions, and with the assistance of a servant maid, whose bravery on this occasion we understand, merits much praise, they succeeded in repulsing the depredators, who soon afterwards retired without accomplishing their purpose.—From thence is supposed the same gang, but considerably increased in numbers, proceeded to Ockbrook, where about three o'clock next morning they attacked and broke into the house of Mr. Hunt, Mill, which they robbed of 35 one pound, and one guinea notes, a quantity of copper coin, and some other articles.

At a meeting of the hosiers held yesterday se'nnight, at Nottingham, it was agreed, that an alteration should be made in the printed list of prices, published in March last, approximating more nearly to the general wishes of the workmen, and which, it was resolved, should be abided by and published. As every symptom of violence had ceased on Monday last, it is to be hoped that the disturbances have terminated.

In a letter from Christmas Day, 1811, to Sir Joseph Banks, naturalist to Captain Cook's first voyage to the South Pacific on the *Endeavour*, one time president of the Royal Society, and a landowner near Pentrich, describes some level of organisation in the collection of monies to support those who had lost their work by virtue of having their frames broken, as well as offering "protection" for frames that were not being operated in ways deemed offensive by the frame breakers.

A vivid account of the frame-breakers' systematic methods in outlying districts is given in a letter of December 25, 1811, to Sir Joshua `[sic]` Banks from his steward, `[H.O., 42. 118]` describing what took place at Pentridge in Derby: '... on Thursday two men came to this place who called themselves inspectors from the Committee, they went to every stockinger's house, and discharged them from working under such prices as they gave them a list of, and said they should come again in a few days, and in case any of them were found working without having a ticket from their Master saying that he was willing to give the prices stated in their list — They should break their frames. They summoned all the Stockingers about twelve or fourteen in number of Master Men to a Publick House, with as much consequence as if they had had a mandate from the Prince Regent. When they got them thither all I can learn at present, was for the purpose of collecting Money from them for the support of those families, who where deprived of getting their bread by having their frames broken. — Where they found a frame worked by a person who had not served a regular apprenticeship, or by a Woman, they discharged them from working, and if they promised to do so, they stuck a paper upon the frame with these words written upon it: "Let this frame stand, the colts removed." — Colt is the name given to all those who have not served a regular apprenticeship.'

How far the existing men's organisations took part in framebreaking or gave it their countenance it is difficult to determine. There was clearly some organisation formed to support the persons deprived of work by the destruction of their machines. ...

```{admonition} Sir Joseph Banks

Sir Joseph Banks has an estate in the area, and apparently lands substantial enough to merit a gamekeeper, as we see from this brief report in the *Nottingham Review* of [Friday 21 February 1817](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001100/18170221/014/0003):

> A gamekeeper of Sir Joseph Banks was shot by a poacher about a fortnight ago. John North, a farmer in the neighbourhood, who was suspected, has been taken up, and the gun left in the wood, at the time of wounding the gamekeeper, is identified by four witnesses as having belonged to him. Three witnesses also recognised the hat left on the ground at the same time. The Prisoner is fully committed to Lincoln jail.

We also hear of an attack on the evening of December 25th, 1811, at South Wingfield, where a certain *Mr. Topham* received a visit from men asking to inspect his frames, then robbing him. *It is not clear whether this is __Benjamin__ Topham, whose address typically seems to be given as Pentridge, or another Mr. Topham. Certainly, it seems that the Mr. Topham referred to below is also a guardian of the poor.* In addition, we learn that the frames that are being broken are in some sense "precision targeted".

:class: dropdown
In *Statesman (London)*, [Monday 06 January 1812](https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002647/18120106/014/0003).

Nottingham, Jan 3.— The alarm excited in Derbyshire, by the numerous burglaries and ' other outrages committed there within the last fourteen or twenty days, has not subsided, and the utmost activity prevails among those whose property is considered in any danger, as well as among the Civil and Military Authorities in general. Whether the depredators consist of that body of men, which has lately been concerted in frame-breaking, or of other desperadoes, who have taken advantage of the confusion into which this part of the country has been hurled, by the practices of the former, remains at present unascertained; in either case, however, our surprise is less excited at the depredations, than our indignation at the depredators; for crime advances by as regular a progress, as does the noxious weed in the garden, if it is not timely eradicated. — In addition to the burglaries committed in Derbyshire, as named in our last, we have to record one of serious nature, which was perpetrated in the house of Mr. Topham, in South Wingfield Park, on the 25th of December, at night. The robbers entered in disguise, and demanded to examine Mr. Topham's frames; and when they had gained admittance, under that pretence, likewise demanded his cash, which they took away to the amount of about 62*l.* as also the parish books, he being overseer of the poor. In our own neighbourhood, it is with much pleasure we have to state, that the outrages weekly diminish in number, though not in magnitude. On Friday evening a valuable plain silk frame was broken in a house near the Meadow Platts, in this town, belonging to an eminent hosier, which stood between two others of a like description, the property of another gentleman, and they remained untouched. The windows of Mr. Trentham, an eminent manufacturer, in this town, have been twice assailed within these few days by brickbats and stones; and the depredators have not yet been discovered, though a handsome reward been offered.
